    "To design system dynamics models and establish the values of its elements, we can use multiple information sources. Examples of these include, hard data like numerical data collected in company measurement programs, published research, empirical studies, or more soft knowledge captured in written descriptions, observations, mental models, and expert knowledge.\n",

    "### Feeback loops\n",
    "\n",
    "The feedbacks are interactions between the elements of the system. A feedback loop is formed when two elements affect each other mutually. Though systems can behave in different manners, all behaviors stem from two types of basic feedback loops, self-reinforcing or positive feedback and self-correcting or negative feedback. A feedback is positive when a behavior increases or amplifies what is happening; these types of feedback generate exponential growth behaviors. The positive feedback loop structure and distinctive behavior can be seen in Figure 3.1.\n",
    "In contrast, negative feedbacks - Figure 3.2 - are opposed to change. The elements in these relations seek a point of equilibrium or to limit themselves.\n",
    "A feedback can be identified by the signals in the relations, which can be positive (+) or negative (-). The positive sign indicates that the effect is related positively to the cause. It is also common to use a circled arrow with the letter R in to signal positive feedbacks and the letter B for negative feedbacks.\n",
