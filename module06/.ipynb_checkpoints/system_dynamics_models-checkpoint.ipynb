    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "After reviewing the fundamental building blocks of the stock and flow diagram, we will build two simple models. The first model will reproduce the behaviour of an investment account and the second a credit card account.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will require some fundamental financial concepts to guide our modelling exercise in this module. Therefore, please read the following web pages in preparation for the interaction portion:\n",

    "- Interest rates - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\n",

    "## Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interaction, we will focus on two fundamental aspects that create a complex behaviour to a system, feeback loops and nonlinearitires.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feeback loops\n",
    "\n",
    "The feedbacks are interactions between the elements of the system. A feedback loop is formed when two elements affect each other mutually. Though systems can behave in different manners, all behaviors stem from two types of basic feedback loops, self-reinforcing or positive feedback and self-correcting or negative feedback. \n",
    "\n",
    "A feedback is positive when a behavior increases or amplifies what is happening; these types of feedback generate exponential growth behaviors. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, negative feedbacks are opposed to change. The elements in these relations seek a point of equilibrium or to limit themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nonlinearities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore feedback loops and nonlinearities, we will create two models, an investment and a credit card accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Investment Account Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- The interest rate is 5% anually.\n",
    "- The term of the investment (time horizon) is 10 years or 120 months.\n",
    "- The initial capital is 100,000 CAD.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interest is compounded monthly. The way the interest is compounded vary depending on the investment type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model only permits deposits obtained from the interests earned.\n",
    "- The model doesn't allow withdraws from the investment account.\n",
    "- The model assumes the interest rate is fixed for the simulated term.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit Card Account Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- The interest rate is 20% anually.\n",
    "- There are two types of payments, minimum payment and fixed payments.\n",
    "- The two payment types don't occur simultaneously.\n",
    "- The minimum payment is determined by a percentage of the pending balance.\n",
    "- The fixed payment is determined by a percentage of the initial amount of debt.\n",
    "- Both payment types use the same percentage value of 2%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The annual interest rate is compounded monthly; unline some credit cards that charge interest daily.\n",
    "- The model doesn't permits additional payments.\n",
    "- The model doesn't include increses in the amount of debt due to additional expenses TODO ?.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investment Account Model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recreate the two models covered in class.\n",
    "- Explore changes to the initial conditions of the models and analyze the results.\n",
    "    - Investment Account Model\n",
    "        - Increase the term of the investment to 30 years\n",
    "    - Credit Card Model\n",
    "        - Increase the payment rule to 5%\n",
    "- Estimate the behaviour of your models using the following online calculators\n",
    "    - Investment calculator - https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html\n",
    "    - Credit card calculator - https://www.calculator.net/credit-card-calculator.html\n",
    "- Compare your simulation results to the estimations obtained with the online calculators to determine the accuracy of the models"

    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Option\n",
    "\n",
    "Research or reflect on what relevant elements or variables could be added to the investment and credit account models from the consumer's perspective of these financial products. Create improved diagrams connecting the additional variables identified during the research and the provided stock and flow diagrams. Include formulas or descriptions explaining the new elements and their relationships. The newly added elements and variables don't need to follow the stock and flow format and structure but should integrate the main elements of the models covered in the module. Please submit a 2-3 page Word document with your diagrams and explanations. Reference the consulted sources using the APA format.\n",

    "### Hands-on Option\n",
    "\n",
    "Select two banks you are familiar with from the same country; for example, TD and National Bank from Canada. Find the current values of the variables (interest rates, minimum credit card payment, typical investment term, etc.) included in the models reviewed in the module. If the required data is not readily available, you can make assumptions about the values but indicate this in your report. Calibrate the models using the obtained data and simulate them. Analyze the model results of the two banks. Based on your analysis, determine which of the two banks you would recommend using. Compare your results to the online calculators provided by the selected banks to determine how accurate the model predictions are. Please submit a 1-2 page Word document summarizing your analysis. Reference the consulted sources using the APA format."
