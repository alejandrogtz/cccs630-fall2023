    "System dynamics does not predict the future (Forrester, 1999b). The behavior of the system is generated solely by what has been included in the model. The dynamic behavior of the system is determined by the interaction between the feedback loops of a system, its structure, time delays and nonlinearities (Sterman, 2000).\n",

    "|Detail of the results | The results of the simulation are obtained in an aggregated fashion. It is necessary to assume averages or general rules. It is not possible to control or track individual units in the simulation. |\n",
    "| Precision of estimates generated through simulations | It is common to find differences when comparing simulation estimates with results of the real system. Several factors contribute in making system dynamics estimates inaccurate compared to the results of applying the changes in the real system. To start, the use of aggregated data decreases accuracy. Besides, it is necessary to accept that noise can exist within the system or when measuring results. Furthermore, in the perspective of system dynamics it is more important to see the changes in the behavior than having estimation accuracy. |\n",
    "| Level of detail of data used to calibrate the model | To get simulation results closest to reality, it is advisable to use data also closest to reality to calibrate the models. It is common for companies not to have the level of detail needed to calibrate the simulation models. This makes it difficult to calibrate the models with trustworthy data. Nonetheless, system dynamics minimizes this difficulty considering it is preferable to make an estimate of value over the option not to include it in the model. |"
