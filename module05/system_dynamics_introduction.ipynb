    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We can choose various approaches to model and simulate a complex system. So far in the course, we have explored cellular automata and agent-based simulations. Now, we are changing gears and exploring a new technique in this module. We will review system dynamics as a technique relevant when the represented system shows non-linearities, feedback loops, and delays. In this module, we will cover what these concepts mean, the main principles of system dynamics, its elements and considerations so we can read and understand system dynamics models.\n",

    "System dynamics is a perspective as well as a set of tools with which it is possible to study and understand complex systems. It builds on theories developed in mathematics, physics, and engineering. From among these, nonlinear dynamics and feedback control are recognized as foundational(Sterman, 2000). An origin can also be found in the servomechanism theory (Martin 2004). A servomechanism is an instrument where there is a feedback connection between the outputs to the inputs (Martin 2004).\n",
    "System dynamics can be applied to analyze any change process in physical and social systems (Forrester 1999). Therefore, the potential areas of application are endless, from the study of population dynamics in a group of animals, to changes in public policies, to technology assessments and even to understanding how the human body works [Forrester 1999a].\n",
    "A key concept in system dynamics is mental models. Mental models are the way we understand the reality around us and the problems we attempt to resolve. Every person has mental models and operates based on them; they shape our perception of the world. Most of the time, we are unknowing of their presence. However, these perceptions are not perfect, they have deficiencies. Generally, feedbacks processes involved in a system are not considered. We have an open-loop perspective with which we perceive reality as a sequence of events where A leads to B and B leads to C. Reality is much more complex. For example, C can affect A again, but with a time delay in its effect. Moreover, human cognitive abilities make it difficult to estimate the existing nonlinearities. To summarize, we ignore interconnections, nonlinearities and time delays that shape the dynamic behavior of systems.\n",
    "In addition, human perception is altered by emotions, motives and others human factors.\n",
    "Consequently, attempts to change or solve a problem in a system result in what is commonly known as side effects. Sometimes changes or improvements introduced in a system, such as introducing a new technology, create problems bigger or worse to the previous problem or status. The consequences or effects, intended and unintended, appear even if we do our best effort in solving a problem.\n",
    "When the actions applied in a system are delayed, diluted or defeat by reactions it´s known as policy resistance [Sterman 2000]. Policy, in system dynamics, is everything that makes someone to behave in certain way [Forrester 1999a].\n",
    "System dynamics allows building, simulating and studying models that consider the interconnections, nonlinearities and time delays of systems. The simulations of the model are performed using a software package, without the need to make calculations manually. The simulations provide the behavior of the system over time.\n",
    "The simulation models become a virtual building ground. Over this ground, changes can be introduced to the system in a rapid, cost effective manner, with no affectation to the real system. The models can be used to test theories, strategies or assumptions considering the complexities of the system.\n",
    "System dynamics does not predict the future [Forrester 1999b]. The behavior of the system is generated solely by what has been included in the model. The dynamic behavior of the system is determined by the interaction between the feedback loops of a system, its structure, time delays and nonlinearities [Sterman 2000].\n",
    "To understand more about system dynamics it is necessary to know a few of the composing principles and elements. The following section explains the concept of system and the different ways to perceive one. Then, the key elements to develop system dynamics models will be presented.\n",
    "3.2.2 VISIONS OF A SYSTEM\n",
    "A system is one of those concepts with several definitions, which makes it necessary to have a guideline for reference throughout this study. The following is a list of different visions of a system:\n",
    "\t“Combination of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purposes” [ISO/IEC/IEEE 2010]\n",
    "\t“Grouping of parts that operate together for a common purpose” [Forrester 1971]\n",
    "\t“A system contains multiple components that interact with each other and perform some function together that can-not be done by individual components” [Madachy 2008]\n",
    "Based on these definitions, this work considers that the essence of a system is the interconnection of elements and the sense of purpose.\n",
    "3.2.3 CLASSIFICATIONS OF A SYSTEM\n",
    "There are different classifications of a system. They depend on the system perspectives of its past actions’ effects, change over time and where the system boundary is placed.\n",
    "A system can be classified as open or close depending of the perspective of its past actions effects. In an open system there are no feedbacks between outputs and inputs. This implies that the system is unaware of its past behavior. In a closed system there is a feedback between outputs and inputs. Changes in variables affect back the initial variables, closing a circle. System dynamics applies a closed perspective.\n",
    "A system can also be static or dynamic. If the variables that describe the system don’t change over time it is a static system. Conversely, a system is dynamic if the variables change. Changes in variables are part of the complexity of real systems.\n",
    "If a system is dynamic, it can be categorized as discrete, continuous or combined depending on how its variables change over time [Madachy 2008]. A system is discrete if variables changes are instantaneous at separated time points. In this type of system, events are analyzed individually. The opposite is true for continuous systems, where the system variables change over time without breaks or irregularities. The events are considered as an aggregate that can be described using differential equations and the time changes at a constant rate. System dynamics uses a continuous view. As can be inferred, the combined vision is a mix of the discrete and continuous perspectives to try and benefit from the strengths of both.\n",
    "A system can be exogenous or endogenous, depending on where the limits are set. In the exogenous perspective, the behavior is originated from outside the system. There are external factors or strengths over which the system has no control. By contrast, the elements that cause behaviors or problems in an endogenous system are within the boundaries of the system. In system dynamics the behavior stems from the variables and elements in the model, thus, an endogenous perspective is used.\n",
    "3.2.4 SYSTEM DYNAMICS PRINCIPLES AND ELEMENTS\n",
    "Apart from the perspective from which the system is regarded, there are other principles and elements that must be considered when working with this method.\n",
    "3.2.4.1 MODELS\n",
    "Models and simulation models play a fundamental role in system dynamics. To understand what a simulation model is, it is necessary to begin with the definition of a model. According to Kellner et al. [1999], a model is “an abstraction of a real or conceptual complex system”. It is a representation of reality [Madachy 2008]. Furthermore, as stated by Williams [2002], the model simplifies the entity it represents. It helps to display features and characteristics of a system but it does not include all its aspects, only the relevant aspects necessary to the objective that it is intended for [Kellner et al. 1999]. The aspects that are included in the model are the ones especially relevant to the issues and questions the model is projected to address and are selected by the modeler(s) [Kellner et al. 1999].\n",
    "3.2.4.2 SIMULATION MODELS\n",
    "A simulation model is a model that can be simulated using a software package. The result of the simulation is the behavior of the system. To obtain this behavior, it is necessary to define the relations between the elements of the model using mathematic equations and establish their initials values.\n",
    "3.2.4.3 INFORMATION SOURCES\n",
    "To create the models and establish the values of its elements for a simulation, numerical data, written description and observations from mental models can be used. The information required can be obtained from different sources, among others, company measurement programs, published research, empirical data and expert knowledge.\n",
    "3.2.4.4 MENTAL MODELS\n",
    "The emphasis regarding mental models in system dynamics is considerable and has been present from its origin.\n",
    "Although this chapter discusses how mental models can limit the understanding of systems, they can also be seen as a source of information. Mental models are also one of the most important sources of information. Forrester [1999a] asserts that we know more than we think we know.\n",
    "The mental model represent the “beliefs about the network of causes and effects that describe how a system operates, along with the boundary of the model and the time horizon” relevant to the problem [Sterman 2000]. System dynamics allows you to elicit and clarify the mental models of the people involved in a problem [Sterman 2000].\n",
    "3.2.4.5 FEEDBACKS LOOPS\n",
    "The feedbacks are interactions between the elements of the system. A feedback loop is formed when two elements affect each other mutually. Though systems can behave in different manners, all behaviors stem from two types of basic feedback loops, self-reinforcing or positive feedback and self-correcting or negative feedback. A feedback is positive when a behavior increases or amplifies what is happening; these types of feedback generate exponential growth behaviors. The positive feedback loop structure and distinctive behavior can be seen in Figure 3.1.\n",
    "In contrast, negative feedbacks - Figure 3.2 - are opposed to change. The elements in these relations seek a point of equilibrium or to limit themselves.\n",
    "A feedback can be identified by the signals in the relations, which can be positive (+) or negative (-). The positive sign indicates that the effect is related positively to the cause. It is also common to use a circled arrow with the letter R in to signal positive feedbacks and the letter B for negative feedbacks.\n",

    "It is also important to mention the deficiencies or difficulties of applying system dynamics, the most important of which are summarized in Table 3.1.\n",
    "Concept\tDescription\n",
    "Detail of the results \tThe results of the simulation are obtained in an aggregated fashion. It is necessary to assume averages or general rules. It is not possible to control or track individual units in the simulation.\n",
    "Precision of estimates generated through simulations\tIt is common to find differences when comparing simulation estimates with results of the real system. Several factors contribute in making system dynamics estimates inaccurate compared to the results of applying the changes in the real system. To start, the use of aggregated data decreases accuracy. Besides, it is necessary to accept that noise can exist within the system or when measuring results. Furthermore, in the perspective of system dynamics it is more important to see the changes in the behavior than having estimation accuracy.\n",
    "Level of detail of data used to calibrate the model\tTo get simulation results closest to reality, it is advisable to use data also closest to reality to calibrate the models. It is common for companies not to have the level of detail needed to calibrate the simulation models. This makes it difficult to calibrate the models with trustworthy data. Nonetheless, system dynamics minimizes this difficulty considering it is preferable to make an estimate of value over the option not to include it in the model.\n",

    "Stock and flow maps can be designed and simulated using one simulation software packages available for system dynamics. STELLA® [isee systems 2011], iThink® [isee systems 2011] and Vensim® [Ventana 2012] are examples of software packages designed for these purposes.

    " \tStock, Level or Accumulation\tStocks are in charge of accumulating matter, energy, information or knowledge of the represented system. As the simulation advances in time, the rates update the accumulations in the stocks. A different stock must be used for each element being simulated. If a snapshot of the system is taken at any given time if the simulation, the stocks would be reviewed to determine the status of the system.\n",
    " \tRate or Flow\tRates are used to increase or decrease the accumulated amount in a stock. If the arrow points to the stock, an accumulation occurs. Conversely, if the arrow departs from the stock, a reduction occurs. Rates are conceptual representations of what goes on in the system; they can be defined as constant values or equations. They can also be determined using auxiliary variables or stocks.\n",
